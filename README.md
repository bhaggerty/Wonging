Wonging
=======

A little card counting tool, mainly to help myself and my friend(s) to train our minds

Wonging: Back-counting, consists of standing behind a blackjack table that other players are playing on, and counting the cards as they are dealt. Stanford Wong first proposed the idea of back-counting, and the term "Wong" comes from his name.
